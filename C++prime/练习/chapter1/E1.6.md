### Question
> Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1; 
        << " and " << v2;
         << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

### Answer
> not legal.
* the way to fix it 
```C++
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1 // no semi-colon;
             << " and " << v2 // no  semi-colon;
             << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
